                          <p className="text-secondary"><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Yes. BUT it's better to activate the payment through the Paypal. The paypal accept the International Credit Card, like Visa/MasterCard/American Express/Diners Club/JCB. Paypal offers a secure method to send money from your credit card without telling online shops your credit card numbers. You choose which method to use on the second-to-last screen of the online checkout process, and this screen gives you instructions how to make the payment.</p>

                          <p className="text-secondary"><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;If we returned your money to you and closed your order, it is almost certainly because we were unable to verify your payment or the products you ordered were out of stock. Generally, our customer service staff will contact you by phone or email to discuss with you,but if we can not get in touch with you in 5 days after we receive your payment,we will have to refund for you. As we think,It is our responsibility to ship out your order in time.</p>
                          <p className="text-secondary">Possible reasons for refunding money are: - Paypal account name and address does not match your order's shipping address, and there was no response when we contacted you.</p>
                          <p className="text-secondary">- The the products you ordered were out of stock(Generally we have enough stock but rarely we may suffer an temporarily lack of certain product ), and there was no response when we contacted you.</p>
